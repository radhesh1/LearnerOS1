# LearnerOS1

A simple OS template for those who wish to get started with OS dev

## What does this do?

This is a simple and minimalistic implementation of a bootloader and a kernel to boot the OS from the disk, load the kernel and indicate the same by printing a message on the screen.

## Purpose

If you want to learn more about OS dev but couldn't find any simple source on the same, then you can use this repository as a reference. Modern operating systems are much more complicated than this implementation, so it is advisable to refer to other sources such as [OSdev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page) once you have a better understanding on OS dev

## Building the project

If your system needs to set file permissions for the build script, use the command below:

`chmod +x build.sh`

Once permissions are set, run the command below to compile the source files and boot the OS:

`./build.sh`

See **dependencies** for more info on required libraries and software installed
